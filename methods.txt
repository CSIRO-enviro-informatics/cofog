Preparation of this SKOS COFOG 
------------------------------
from original at http://registry.it.csiro.au/def/agldwg/cofog

- removed registry information
- added inScheme to each Concept
- added ConceptScheme type to the Registry object
- removed rtfs:label from concepts (they have skos:prefLabels)
- converted dct:description properties to skoks:definition for Concepts
- replaced all hyphens in URIs to make ID parts purely numerical
