# COFOG in SKOS
A pure SKOS rendition of the Classification of the Functions of Government vocabulary

COFOG, "Classification of the Functions of Government", is a [United Nations Statistics Division](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/iiss/Classification-of-the-Functions-of-Government-COFOG.ashx)-issued vocabulary used to "...distinguish between the individual and collective services provided by general government and identifies consumption expenditures that benefit individual households...". This representation of COFOG is as a pure [Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/) vocabulary meaning that the content is presented witn only SKOS and simple annotation properties.

This SKOS-only version of COFOG was produced by editing a Registry Ontology version of SKOS presented at <http://registry.it.csiro.au/def/agldwg/cofog>. The reason for this re-presentation is to provide a simpler representation of COFOG for those familiar with SKOS but not the Registry Ontology.
